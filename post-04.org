#+title: Investigating the Internet using Lisp
#+Author: Della-Vos Group

* Introduction
  
To investigate the internet you will need an http client tool, some
data visualization tool, and you may need a natural language
processing system.

* Http clients
  
Examples of http clients built in Lisp:

* Data visualization

A good example of how to show results and make research reports on the
Internet is this COVID-19 data exploration system:

* Natural language processing

For best results when exploring the internet, you should also use a
natural language processing system, such as the tagger:

If you really want powerful systems, then you'll need to contact Cycorp:

Cycorp offers powerful natural language resources and is being used in
large projects, such as the Cleveland Clinic's natural language
interface for biomedical information
(https://my.clevelandclinic.org/), and Sanctuary.ai's robots that have
human-like AI ( https://sanctuary.ai/)
